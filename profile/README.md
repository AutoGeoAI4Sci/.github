# 👋 Hi there, welcome to AutonomousGeoAI4Science!

🌍🤖 **AutonomousGeoAI4Science** is an open research and learning community for people who are passionate about **AI, geospatial science, and scientific discovery**.

We bring together **tutorials, open-source code, research projects, and papers** to explore how autonomous and multimodal GeoAI systems can advance spatial thinking, Earth observation, and AI-driven science.

**We welcome contributors at all levels to join us, share ideas, build openly, and collectively shape the future of autonomous GeoAI for science.**
